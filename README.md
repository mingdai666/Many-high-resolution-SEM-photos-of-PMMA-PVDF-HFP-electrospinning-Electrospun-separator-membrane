# Many-high-resolution-SEM-photos-of-PMMA-PVDF-HFP-electrospinning-Electrospun-separator-membrane
Here is an SCI paper supporting project file.
Electrospun membranes of PMMA and PMMA&PVDF-HFP were prepared at similar concentrations and voltages, and 35 SEM images were taken for each sample. 
The paper presents an interesting modeling work, and you are welcome to read it~ 
The original image data will be stored in the google network disk，see link：
