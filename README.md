Here is an SCI paper supporting project file.  

Phenomena seemingly random also have a scale, and the size of the scale is often expressed as fractal dimension. The electrospinning membrane with microscopically long fiber network structure is one of the typical random complex structures. In this article, a large number of SEM images for electrospun membranes were analyzed and improved for the fractal dimension to measure the random scale of their structures. On this basis, the fractal dimension control for its 2D model was realized based on the genetic algorithm through modeling in MATLAB, that is, a random reconstruction model for the long fiber network with specified random scale size was generated. At last, based on the characteristics of electrospinning process, a method to convert this 2D model to a 3D model of electrospinning film in ABAQUS was proposed. Compared with the mainstream random reconstruction method, this paper further analyzed the randomness and controlled it in the modeling process, which promoted the randomness scale consistency between model and physical object for the random complex fiber network.

Specifically, we prepared electrospun membranes of PMMA and PMMA & PVDF-HFP under analogous concentrations and voltages (15/18/21kv), obtaining 35 SEM images for each sample. These images, along with the article, are accessible for download via the provided Google Drive link.
