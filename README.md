# Many-high-resolution-SEM-photos-of-PMMA-PVDF-HFP-electrospinning-Electrospun-separator-membrane
Here is an SCI paper supporting project file./n
Electrospun membranes of PMMA and PMMA&PVDF-HFP were prepared at similar concentrations and voltages, and 35 SEM images were taken for each sample. 
Due to limited storage space, only thumbnail images of SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) are provided in this GitHub repository. 
The original resolution image data will be stored in the google network disk，see link：https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A6UUVuiRN_EP3sfhePbZEj-ZKLeWB3h9?usp=sharing

I plan to delegate the follow-up work of this paper to my future students. 
Once they have completed it, I will provide all the original codes of this paper (perhaps in 2025, I hope I can find a job soon ^^).
The paper presents an interesting modeling work, and you are welcome to read it~
